## Data Science Project Template
Protip for interactive mode in VSCode:
Settings > User > "jupyter interactive window" > "when pressing shift+enter, send selected code in a Pytho file to the Jupyter interactive window"

You can use this template to structure your Python data science projects. It is based on [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
